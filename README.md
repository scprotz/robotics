# Robotics Team for Winburn Middle School

This is the home page for the robotics team for Winburn Middle School.  On here you'll find some quick getting started tips on how to work with the Lego Mindstorms and EV3DEV and also how to set up your computer.  If you have any issues, put a note in the Issues section and hopefully someone will be be able to provide a quick answer.

## Getting Started

So the first thing you'll need to do is get all the equipment you will need and a computer to work on.  So here are the assumptions that we'll start with:

1)  You need to have a Lego Mindstorms EV3 block (the computer part of it)
2)  You need a computer to work from.  I'll try to give reasonable instructions for the 3 main platforms (Windows, Mac, and Linux)

*) You'll need a good internet connection and this can be kind of a pain depending on how locked down your laptop is and if you have wifi or not for your robot.

### Setting up EV3DEV on your robot.

Here are the quick steps:

1)  Download EV3DEV to your computer from [https://github.com/ev3dev/ev3dev/releases/download/ev3dev-stretch-2018-08-06/ev3dev-stretch-ev3-generic-2018-08-06.zip](https://github.com/ev3dev/ev3dev/releases/download/ev3dev-stretch-2018-08-06/ev3dev-stretch-ev3-generic-2018-08-06.zip)

2)  You need to put that on a Micro-SD card.  To do that, you need a program called Etcher.  You can get Etcher at [https://www.balena.io/etcher/](https://www.balena.io/etcher/).  Get the version appropriate for your Windows/Mac/Linux computer.

3)  Install Etcher and run it.  Use a Micro-SD from 8GB-32GB for your ev3dev image.  IT WILL BE ERASED.  Let me say that again.  IT WILL BE ERASED.

4)  Etcher will asked for an image.  Unzip the one from step 1.  On some computers this might be called 'extract'.  Just extract it somewhere that you know (like your Downloads folder).  Point Etcher to it.  Also when Etcher asks, point it to the SD card.  This will make an EV3DEV image for your Mindstorms.


WooHoo!.  Take the Micro-SD and put it in your Mindstorms and start it.  You should be all set.

### Setting up your computer

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
